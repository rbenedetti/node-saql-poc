# node-saql-poc

Overview 

This POC demonstrates the use of OAuth 2.0 from a client application - in this case, a node.js application running on Heroku - to connect to Salesforce and submit a SAQL query to the Einstein Analytics API (aka the /wave/query REST API resource).

You will need to create a Connected App app in your Salesforce org and then add the Client Id / Secret as config vars in Heroku:

Login into Salesforce
Go to Setup > Apps > App Manager
Select 'New Connected App'
Enter Connected App Name: <name>
Enter API Name: <auto-generated from name>
Email: <your email or an administrative email>
Select Enable OAuth Settings
Enter Callback URL: <1 or more callback urls>
e.g. https://<Heroku App Name>.herokuapp.com
e.g. http://localhost:<port>
Select Selected OAuth Scope: Full access (full)
You can review the complete list of scopes here
Select 'Save'

The connected app will generate a Client Secret and Client Id, to be used in the client app. 

Client App

The code for the POC is in the web.js file. The package.json file tells Heroku what dependencies web.js needs.
